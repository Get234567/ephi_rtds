                Executive Summary
      The Geshiyaro intervention impact will be measuring through annual, longitudinal parasitological sentinel site surveillance across approximately 15% of all kebeles. The data presented here are baseline data from 3,926 individuals sampled in 26 sentinel sites between January and March 2020. In each site prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni, Hookworm, Trichuris, Ascaris and Schistosoma haematobium were investigated within the community from pre-school aged children (SAC) until adults. The overall prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni was low (3.02% by Kato Katz; 14% by trace -ve POC-CCA; and 21% by trace +ve POC-CCA), with an arithmetic mean intensity of infection of 0.88 eggs per gram (epg). Furthermore, very few heavy infections (0.7%) were detected. Equally, the prevalence of Hookworm, Trichuris and Ascaris was low at 12.5%, 3.02% and 13.0%, with an arithmetic mean intensity of infection of 22.4 epg, 16.8%, and 224 epg, respectively. Heavy infections were only detected in hookworm at low levels (0.08%). This lack of heavy infections in both species is important and promising for transmission break since there are very few individuals harbouring heavy egg burdens to maintain transmission in a community.  This is also the first data on schistosomiasis and STH infection rates among adults in Ethiopia and demonstrates the importance of community level treatment.

                MDA in Bolosso Sore was carried out between November 20th and December 13th, 2019. Overall, treatment coverage was 63% for both albendazole (ALB) and praziquantel (PZQ).
                The total population of Bolosso Sore was determined by the Geshiyaro census (as per the census report circulated in March 2020, which included all individuals registered in 2018 and the “mop-up” in 2019). All individuals in the population denominator included those ≥ 1 year who are eligible for ALB and those ≥ 4 years for PZQ. Women who presented at MDA but declined treatment citing the reason as ‘pregnant’

      <br>
                                A total of 132,966 treatment records were registered in the November Bolosso Sore MDA. Data removed included <br> (i) duplicated individual records and <br> (ii) fraudulent names. A total of 23,315 treatment records were removed in the cleaning process, resulting in 109,652 records in the clean MDA treatment dataset (including both ALB and/or PZQ treatment).
                          i - Duplicated Records (Identification Pathways)
                          A total of 112,924 treatment records were registered through one of the three identification pathways (biometric, ID card or name search). Overall, 19,285 treatment records were discarded due to duplication. Reasons for duplication included multiple records with the same ID card, biometric, searched name or a combination of the pathways (i.e. one treatment record by biometric identification, in addition to a separate treatment record documented by ID card identification for the same individual).
                          For example, one subject (barcode: 123123, kebele: Tiyo Hembecho) had 315 treatment records that had the same study ID card. As per protocol, if a biometric identification is not successful the HEW is prompted to attempt a biometric registration for that individual. For 59 of these records a new biometric registration occurred in the treatment record. It is not possible to determine from the data whether the HEW is purposefully duplicating data or does not have the skills to follow the form instructions.
                          It is important to note that the majority (77.4%) of duplicated treatment records were found to be in a pair (i.e. 2 records to one participant), which implies a higher degree of certainty that this is a true duplicate and the same person and not fraudulent registration. However, these extreme ‘duplication’ examples do exist and require an extensive amount of work in cleaning the data to determine the true individual.
                          ii - New Registration Treatment Records
                          17,126 treatment records were received through the ‘new registration’ pathway. For all new registration records, each person was assessed to determine: <br>(i) if the name was a true name (i.e. not xyz or 123),<br> (ii) if the name string was a ‘full’ name string (e.g. ‘John Smith’), and <br>(iii) if there was a census record that matches the demographic information of the new registration in the kebele. All treatment records where the name string was deemed to be a false name were removed. 3,376 treatment records were removed due to a ‘false’ name string. The remaining 13,750 records (17,126-3,376 = 13,750) were verified that they did not match another treatment record (this resulted in the removal of 654 records).

                Baseline data on household (HH) water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) infrastructure and practices were collected at all consenting households during a WaSH survey in September 2019. The survey was carried out in two woredas, Damot Pulasa and Damot Sore, which were not selected for the population census but will still receive WaSH intervention. The purpose of this survey was to collect baseline WaSH coverage prior to the start of the intervention by World Vision Ethiopia. The primary objectives of the survey were:<br><br>
          •	To estimate the coverage of WaSH access prior to the intervention in Damot Pulasa and Damot Sore.<br>
          •	To provide a baseline against which to measure progress made in hardware and software improvements by comparing with the baseline WaSH findings (this survey) with a WaSH Assessment survey to be carried out later in 2021.

                Open Defecation Free (ODF) is defined primarily and most basically as the absence of the practice of open defecation (OD) in a prescribed community. Implicitly it means that all members of that community have access to and are using a latrine. Communities free of open defecation practices and with improved sanitation is a desired goal for the Geshiyaro project as the transmission of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis thrives in unsanitary conditions.
                <br>
                <b>The specific ODF verification survey objectives are:</b><br>
      •	Total elimination of open defecation practices.<br>
      •	100% coverage of latrine use.<br>
      •	Improved personal, household and environmental hygiene through education.<br>
      •	Increased ownership and sustainability of hygiene and sanitation activities through education.<br>
      •	Contribution to reduction in sanitation related diseases. <br><br>
      For the Geshiyaro project, ODF status had been declared and verified in 12 out of 32 kebeles (40%) in Bolosso Sore district at three levels - the woreda (district), kebele (community) by World Vision Ethiopia (WVE). An independent team from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI), with support from the London Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease Research (LCNTDR), carried out evaluation of ODF verification in the 12 kebeles. Overall 30% of the total number of households in each kebele (a total of 3,548 households across all 12 kebeles) were earmarked for survey. In addition, all schools, health facilities, religious centres were observed for the presence of functional latrines, handwashing facilities and evidence of open defecation. Open areas, such as sport fields, and previous open defecation sites were observed for evidence of faeces. The presence of functional community latrines was also assessed. <br>

              <br>
      Of the 3286 households visited during ODF evaluation, 3161 (96%) had functional latrines. 67% of the households without latrines fell within three kebeles (Basa Gofara, Dachi Gofara, Gara Goda and Tiyo Hembecho). Reporting latrine use in households without latrines, some of these households admitted to defecating in the surrounding bushes or burying their faeces. All health facilities had latrines that were functional. However, six out of seven religious centres, and three out of 19 schools did not have latrines. There was evidence of both fresh and dry faeces in public areas, mostly by the road side, with Gara Goda and Admancho Arfita kebeles recording the most episodes. <br>
